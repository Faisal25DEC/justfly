# Travel agency static site

Travel agency site based on this [template](https://github.com/NextJSTemplates/startup-nextjs). I kept the original readme file of the template in the project under the name [README.template.md](./README.template.md).

## 4 pages

- Landing page with major airline companies
- Hajj & Umrah packages
- Cargo
- Injury claims

For the carousel on the landing page I used [react-slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/) instead of [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/get-started). On the Swiper website they say:

> Swiper React components will likely to be removed in future versions. It is recommended to migrate to Swiper Element instead.
> If you are upgrading from Swiper 9 to Swiper 10, check out Migration Guide to Swiper 10
> If you are looking for v9 docs, they are here v9.swiperjs.com

I removed the unused parts from the template from the projecrt directory. The template used [wowjs](https://github.com/graingert/wow) animations here and there but didn't specify it as a dependency in the project so I left it as it is.
